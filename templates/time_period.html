    <h2 class="section-header-words">Archaic Period</h2>
</div>
    <p class="information">
        The Archaic period was a formative era in ancient Greece, bridging the gap between the rigid geometric styles of earlier centuries and the naturalism of the Classical age.
        Politically, this was a time when the Greek city-states, or poleis, were developing their distinctive systems of government, 
        including the early roots of democracy in Athens. Trade and colonization expanded Greek influence across the Mediterranean, bringing cultural exchange and new ideas.<br>
        <br>
        In art, the period is especially remembered for its sculpture. Artists created large-scale marble statues known as kouroi (standing male youths) 
        and korai (clothed female figures), which served both religious and commemorative purposes. These works show a shift from stiff, 
        stylized forms toward more realistic anatomy, though features like the famous “Archaic smile” remained symbolic rather than naturalistic.<br>
        <br>
        Vase painting also flourished, beginning with the black-figure technique, in which silhouetted figures were incised with details, 
        and later evolving into the more refined red-figure style, which allowed for greater flexibility and realism in depicting movement. 
        Common themes included mythological tales, heroic legends, athletic contests, and daily life.<br>
        <br>
        Overall, the Archaic period was an age of experimentation and innovation, setting the stage for the artistic achievements of Classical Greece.<br>

        <h2 class="section-header-words">Classical Period</h2>
    </div>
        <p class="information">
        The Classical period of Greek art is often seen as the high point of ancient artistic achievement. 
        Following the Persian Wars, Athens emerged as a cultural and political center, and artists sought to express ideals of harmony, balance, and proportion. 
        Sculpture from this era emphasized naturalism while still reflecting an idealized human form, with masterpieces like Myrons Discobolus and Polykleitos Doryphoros 
        setting standards for beauty and proportion.<br>
        <br>
        Architecture also flourished, with the Parthenon in Athens symbolizing both artistic mastery and civic pride. 
        Advances in technique allowed for lifelike poses, realistic anatomy, and calm, confident expressions — a sharp contrast to the stiffness of Archaic art.<br>
        <br>
        By the later Classical period, artists began experimenting with more movement and emotional depth, leading naturally 
        into the expressive style of the Hellenistic age. Overall, Classical Greek art captured the balance between realism and idealism, 
        leaving a profound legacy that has influenced Western art for centuries.<br>

        <h2 class="section-header-words">Hellenistic Period</h2>
    </div>
        <p class="information">
        The Hellenistic period began after the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE and extended until the Roman conquest in 31 BCE. 
        This was an age of cultural expansion, as Greek art and ideas spread across Egypt, the Near East, and beyond, blending with local traditions.<br>
        <br>
        Art from this period is known for its drama, realism, and emotional intensity. 
        Sculptors broke away from the idealized calm of the Classical style, creating works that showed movement, vulnerability, and expressive detail. 
        Famous examples include the Laocoön Group and the Winged Victory of Samothrace, which emphasize dynamic poses and theatrical impact.<br>
        <br>
        Hellenistic artists also explored a wider range of subjects — from gods and heroes to children, the elderly, and ordinary people
         — reflecting a more inclusive and human-centered vision of the world. Monumental architecture and urban planning flourished in new centers of power 
         like Alexandria and Pergamon, further showcasing the grandeur of the age.<br>
        <br>
        This was a period of innovation and diversity, where art became more accessible, experimental, and deeply emotional, 
        setting the stage for Roman adaptations in the centuries that followed.<br>

        <h2 class="section-header-words">Roman Art Period</h2>
    </div>
        <p class="information">
        Roman art developed under the influence of earlier Greek traditions but grew into a distinctive style that reflected the empires power, 
        diversity, and practicality. Unlike the idealized forms of Greek art, Roman artists placed a strong emphasis on realism and individuality, 
        particularly in portraiture. Busts and statues of emperors, politicians, and citizens were created with striking detail, often highlighting age, character, and experience.<br>
        <br>
        Architecture was one of Romes greatest achievements. Using innovations like the arch, the dome, and concrete construction, 
        the Romans built monumental structures such as the Colosseum, aqueducts, triumphal arches, and the Pantheon. These works combined engineering 
        genius with a sense of grandeur, designed to showcase the strength and unity of the empire.<br>
        <br>
        Roman painting and mosaics decorated private homes and public buildings, often depicting mythological scenes, landscapes, daily life,
        and elaborate decorative patterns. Frescoes in cities like Pompeii and Herculaneum give us vivid insight into Roman domestic culture.<br>
        <br>
        Overall, Roman art was practical, political, and celebratory — serving not only as decoration but also as propaganda to communicate Romes dominance and the 
        authority of its rulers. It blended Greek ideals with Roman innovation, leaving a lasting influence on Western art and architecture.<br>
